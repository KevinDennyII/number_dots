Number Dots
Based on a React/Redux Tutorial that I took, I created a simple react application that uses a Stack display for the Numbers 1 through 10, with each number diplay the related number of dots.  Great for infants to learn math!

I am using a simple JSON file that has as associated images to correlate with each number.

It is quite buggy at the moment and does not have but on capiblity.  Show the number of dots associated with each number. But maybe my family will inspire me to really move back to completing this app.
